# I can haz RDMDX?

An example of how we might rewrite our custom syntax parser for tabbed code blocks as a remark plugin for MDX. Some details:

- To get started, clone this repo, `npm i` and run the `dev` script
- The custom plugin logic lives in `/lib/remark-test-plugin.js`
- The MDX compilation + custom component logic lives in `/src/App.jsx`
